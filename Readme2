Too many open files error mean that your JVM is not able to open any new file for processing because of the ulimit constraints on the box

ulimit is and being set per userid, so please switch to the user in which weblogic processes are running. Let’s say weblogic is the username

Now execute the following command for the weblogic user account
“ulimit -a” (without quotes)

Check how many open files your useracount is having

/usr/sbin/lsof -u <username> | wc -l

To increase the open file limit for the user account (weblogicusr) you can perform the following configuration changes in the server

Add the following lines in the end of /etc/security/limits.conf file

weblogicusr soft nofile 9384
weblogicusr hard nofile 9384
